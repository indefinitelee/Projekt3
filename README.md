# Projekt3

Your Netflix & chill plans aren't panning out and your (in)significant other wants to hit the town. 
But where to go?

Use Projekt3! (pronounced Pro-yekt tree)

Search for an artist or event and this full-stack web app will use the HTML5 geo-location function to pinpoint your location and pass that information to relevant APIs, (Ticketmaster and YouTube for now) to find events happening around you, and to provide some information and context about that event. e.g. If you search for Ke$ha (but why?) it will show you the most popular Ke$ha video on YouTube as well as link you to her concerts (if any) that are closest to you in location and date.

Once logged in, users will be able to save events to create a history of events attended.

Technologies:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, PSQL, Express, React, Node
